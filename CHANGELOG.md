# Changelog

All notable changes to Plainva are documented here. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and Plainva aims to
follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) once it
reaches 1.0.

## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] — Initial public release

_Release date is set when `v0.1.0` is tagged._

The first public build of Plainva — a local-first Markdown vault editor for
Windows, macOS and Linux. It opens existing Obsidian vaults without migration,
and every file it writes stays readable in any text editor.

> **Beta, pre-1.0.** Keep backups of irreplaceable vaults. Plainva also creates
> local per-file snapshots and daily ZIP backups by default.

### Added

- **Markdown editor** — live preview (Obsidian- or Notion-style syntax display),
  slash menu, tables with inline cell editing, callouts, wiki links with fuzzy
  autocomplete, block drag handles, math (KaTeX), Mermaid diagrams, footnotes,
  emoji via `/emoji` and `:name`, clickable task checkboxes in read mode, and
  print / PDF export.
- **Databases over plain notes (`.base`)** — table, list, card, board, gallery,
  calendar, timeline and graph views over your notes' frontmatter, including
  relations with computed reverse columns and per-view filters. The data is your
  notes; the `.base` format stays Obsidian-compatible.
- **Graph** — a context graph beside every note, a semantic-zoom vault map with
  cleanup tools (orphans, broken links, unlinked mentions) and time travel.
- **Sync through your own storage** — WebDAV/Nextcloud, S3-compatible object
  storage (R2, MinIO, B2, …), Google Drive, OneDrive and Dropbox. Offline queue,
  3-way merge, a visual conflict resolver; credentials live in the OS keychain
  and nothing ever leaves your chosen storage.
- **Versioning and backups** — every write is snapshotted locally; browse, diff
  and restore any version, recover deleted files, and daily ZIP backups with
  retention.
- **Search and performance** — SQLite/FTS5 full-text search as you type with
  operators, incremental indexing, tuned for large vaults.
- **Made yours** — 10 UI languages, 13+ themes, in-app signed auto-updates with
  an opt-out, no telemetry and no account.

### Security

- Content-Security-Policy enforced; the asset protocol is disabled (images load
  as blob URLs with a traversal guard).
- No telemetry, no mandatory cloud; see [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).
